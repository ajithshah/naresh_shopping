# E-commerce Web Application
Node.js application which is a simple e-commerce website where a seller can display their products and manage customers orders.

## Technologies used
Since this application was my first attempt at _backend development_, the _frontend_ was kept simple and basic.
#### Technologies:
   - HTML
   - Bootstrap
   - Node.js
   - Express
   - MongoDB
   - EJS

## Setup
You need to have MongoDB installed and then simply `git clone` the repository and run `npm install` and then run `node index.js`.
To create an admin account, signup for an account and then change the _`isAdmin`_ property of the document in the MongoDB database under the collection called `users`.
•	Admin has the control to Add, Delete, Edit Products and Manage Orders
•	Languages - EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Node.js and MongoDB
•	Customer can place and trace their orders.
